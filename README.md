# Data-Visualization
Project 2 of 3 from "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes.

Data Visualization:
The Data Visualization project starts in Chapter 15, in which youâ€™ll learn to generate data and create a series of functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using matplotlib and Pygal. Chapter 16 teaches you to access data from online sources and feed it into a visualization package to create plots of weather data and a world population map. Finally, Chapter 17 shows you how to write a program to automatically download and visualize data. Learning to make visualizations allows you to explore the field of data mining, which is a highly sought-after skill in the world today.
